
Converting it in to GUI

It is very important to convert any of our python project into GUI because if we want to submit our project in our college or any other place, it is very good to have our project in GUI application. It is because, we can perform every operation within a same window, right? We don't need to execute each cell of code again and again.
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox

window = tk.Tk()
window.title("Face Recognition system")

l1 = tk.Label(window, text="Name", font=("Algerian",20))
l1.grid(column=0, row=0)
t1 = tk.Entry(window, width=50, bd=5)
t1.grid(column=1, row=0)

l2 = tk.Label(window, text="Age", font=("Algerian",20))
l2.grid(column=0, row=1)
t2 = tk.Entry(window, width=50, bd=5)
t2.grid(column=1, row=1)

l3 = tk.Label(window, text="Address", font=("Algerian",20))
l3.grid(column=0, row=2)
t3 = tk.Entry(window, width=50, bd=5)
t3.grid(column=1, row=2)


b1 = tk.Button(window, text="Training", font=("Algerian",20),bg="orange",fg="red")
b1.grid(column=0, row=4)

b2 = tk.Button(window, text="Detect the faces", font=("Algerian",20), bg="green", fg="orange")
b2.grid(column=1, row=4)

b3 = tk.Button(window, text="Generate dataset", font=("Algerian",20), bg="pink", fg="black")
b3.grid(column=2, row=4)

window.geometry("800x200")
window.mainloop()
